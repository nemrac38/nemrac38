- 👋 Hi, I’m @nemrac38
- 👀 I’m interested in trading crypto, learning code, baking, and learning the cello.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about NFT's and everything related to cryptocurrency, especially anything I don't fully understand yet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something when I get the basics down... so when I learn how to code more than indicators on Trading View, which I did not have total success with.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can't! hahaha, unless I reach out to you.
